# GDG UNAM SITE
> A sketch from a Front-end Member

This project is a _sketch_ for GDG UNAM SITE, it isn't the final project, but it will be introduce to their member,
so they can take some good views and re-use sections or/and styles for their website.

## Installing / Getting started

It's so easy to install this project, just need to use `yarn` and `live-server` to get all the stuff.

> Note:

> And that's all you need for this project

### Initial Configuration

As i said on Install, you just need to get `yarn` and `live-server`.

And that's all. Then you need to run, the next commands on your shell.


```shell
live-server .
```

When you run the last command, it will open `index.html` on your default browser.

## Guidelines

### CSS & SCSS
As a developer, i would like to be clear about this project. I know how hard its to maintain a project.

So, I'll let you know **_what/where/why/how_ is my SCSS architecture**.

After searching, and thinking what are the best guidelines. I'll let you two links to know more about it.

* [ CSS ](https://cssguidelin.es/)
* [ SASS / SCSS ](https://sass-guidelin.es/)
 

> ##### **Why do i share this?**
Well, on my experience, it's better to know, how to work and contribute on the project.

So, i prefer to let you know, where did i take my architecture, instead of try to explain more about this topic.

I'll let you the [link for a summary](https://sass-guidelin.es/#too-long-didnt-read).

#### CSS / SCSS syntax

Roughly, we want (shamelessly inspired by CSS Guidelines):

* Two (2) spaces indents, no tabs;
* Ideally, 80-characters wide lines;
* Properly written multi-line CSS rules;
* Meaningful use of whitespace

> _Hope you enjoy!_
